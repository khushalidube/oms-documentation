| Facility Sequence       | Outlet Warehouse, Outlet Store, Retail Warehouse, Retail Store                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The facility sequence is not explicitly mentioned in the M3 logic, but the inclusion of a "Facility Group" filter suggests a potential prioritization based on facility groups.         |
| Order Selection         | Orders are selected based on order date (earliest first).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Orders are selected based on: 1) Facility Group (must be part of "M3_FAC") 2) Order Date (earliest first) 3) Shipment Method (NEXT_DAY, TWO_DAY for expedited, STANDARD otherwise) |
| Single-Line Item Orders | Same logic for both Expedited and Standard shipping:  Prioritize warehouse if available, otherwise broker to the store with sufficient inventory or the nearest store.                                                                                                                                                                                      | No distinction between single-line and multi-line item orders for brokering logic in M3.                                                                                                |
| Multi-Line Item Orders  | Same logic for Expedited and Standard shipping: Prioritize warehouse if available, otherwise broker to the store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | For Standard shipping: Prioritize fulfilling all items at one warehouse or store if possible. If not, split the order and prioritize warehouses for individual items.               |
| Rebrokering             | Same logic for Expedited and Standard shipping: Prioritize warehouse if available, otherwise broker to the store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Same logic as Standard Shipping for both Expedited and Standard in M3.                                                                                                                  |
| Unfillable Orders       | Same logic for Expedited and Standard shipping: Mark as unfillable, set auto-cancel date, and re-broker the next day if inventory becomes available.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Same logic as Standard Shipping for both Expedited and Standard in M3.                                                                                                                  |

**Key Differences Summary:**

*   **Facility Group Filtering:** M3 introduces a new filter based on facility groups ("M3_FAC").
*   **Shipment Method Filtering:** M3 explicitly filters orders based on shipping methods (NEXT_DAY, TWO_DAY, STANDARD).
*   **Combined Brokering Logic:** M3 does not distinguish between single-line and multi-line item orders for most of its brokering logic.
*   **Multi-Line Item Splitting:** M3 has a more sophisticated approach to splitting multi-line item orders when items are not available at a single location, prioritizing warehouses for individual items.
